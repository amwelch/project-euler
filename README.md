# project-euler
A place to keep Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) solutions as I experiment with new languages 

To run the suite and compare performance / correctness across languages you can use run.py:
```
~/project-euler$ ./run.py 
Bad problem directory hello-world
1
	Language       	Answer         	Minutes   Seconds   
	go             	233168         	0         0.157     
2
	Language       	Answer         	Minutes   Seconds   
	go             	4613732        	0         0.159     
3
	Language       	Answer         	Minutes   Seconds   
	go             	6857           	0         0.154     
```
